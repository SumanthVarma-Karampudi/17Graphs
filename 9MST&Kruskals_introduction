Spanning tree:
-> Tree is a graph, which is connected and should not contain any cycles
Spanning tree is simply a tree containing all vertices of a graph but not necessarily all edges of that particular graph.

==>In a Graph            no.of vertices = N  and no.of edges = E
==>In a Spanning Tree     no.of vertices = N  and no.of edges = N-1
MST - Minimum Spanning Tree

Kruskal's algorithm:
Connect the vertices by consider weights of the edges in the ascending order if and only if it doesn't form a cycle.
