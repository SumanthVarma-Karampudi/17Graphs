CYCLE DETECTION:
To check if particular edge connection forms a cycle,we need see that IF THERE IS ANOTHER PATH PRESENT TO REACH ANOTHER VERTEX WHICH WE ARE TRYING TO CONNECT.
But time complexity high O(N+E) sometime it is O(N^2)

                                        Alternate Approach for Cycle Detection:
>>>>>>>>>>>>>UNION FIND>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
Intution behind the UNION FIND is that when ever we are trying to connect two components, we need to make sure that those two vertices are 
from the different components.
